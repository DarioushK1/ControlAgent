The last design (Design 7) achieved a phase margin of 51.378 degrees, which is close to the requirement. To increase the phase margin further, we can increase beta_l, as this will add more phase lead to the system. Additionally, since the settling time is within the acceptable range, we can afford to slightly increase omega_L to help improve the phase margin without compromising the settling time. Therefore, for the next iteration, we will increase beta_l to 10.0 and omega_L to 10.0. We will keep beta_b at 4.0 as it provides a good balance between low-frequency gain and phase margin.\",\n",
