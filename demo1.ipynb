To meet the settling time requirement, we choose omega_L = 4/3.5 = 1.143 rad/s, which is a midpoint value within the desired range. Next, we calculate the proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth. At omega_L = 1.143 rad/s, the magnitude of G(j*omega_L) is |G(j*1.143)| = 4.431/sqrt(1.143^2 + 11.53^2) = 0.384.

However, we must ensure that the phase margin remains above 82.6759 degrees. Let's increase omega_L to 5.0, which should significantly reduce the settling time. We will keep beta_b at 3.162 initially to maintain a reasonable balance between low-frequency gain and phase margin. After adjusting omega_L, we will calculate the proportional gain K_p using the formula K_p = 1/|G(j*omega_L)|. The transfer function G(s) is 4.431/(s + 11.53), so |G(j*omega_L)| = |4.431/(j*5.0 + 11.53)|. This results in K_p = 1/|G(j*5.0)|.
